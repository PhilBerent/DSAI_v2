                            Project Master
                                may add customized tagging specs
                                    e.g.
                                        Patient Name
                                        Relevant employees

                    STE Updating Process
                        Process
                            If a new STE is better than an existing one, update the TD
                            STE# remains unchanged
                            1. STEs generated  (from question or new DI)
                            2. STE searched for in TD
                                if
                                    does not exist
                                        added to TD and new STE# assigned

                                    but different wording exists
                                        1. Search STE compared to Retrieved STE
                                        2. Determination is made of which one
                                            "better"
                                                better descriptor of concept
                                                more likely to be found as search term
                                        3. If
                                            Retrieved STE better

                                 are STE#
                                    rather than the STEs themselves

                                                and everything else
                                        Relationships between entities
                                            e.g.

                            2. If a better descriptor for an STE is found
                                in TD
                                    1. descriptor changed in the TD
                                    2. STE# number remains the same
                                    this means that effectively all of the entries
                                    in the DIIB are also updated with the
                                    new descriptor for this STE

                    2. Relationships between nodes are created
                        Ensures cross-referencing for future queries
                        example

                            and so on
            Retrieval Process
                Stage 1: Extract STE#s from Query
                    Extract SIDs from query
                        Identify key subjects, entities, and relationships
                    Convert to STEs using TD
                Stage 2: Find Relevant Nodes in DIIB
                    Search for nodes with matching STE#s
                    explore connected nodes relevant to query
                        example
                            Query "Give me a summary of the conclusions of  articles which have been written by Dr William Brown of Good Health Hospital" on Infectious Diseases in the last 3 years"
                                1. Find node for the correct Dr William Brown by checking for Good Health hospital either as a property or a relationship to the node for the hospital
                                look for all nodes to which the Dr's node has the relation AUTHOR_OF and have the label "Article"
                                for all of these nodes filter out onese where
                                    the subject is not "Infectious Diseases"
                                    the date of publication is outside those requested
                Stage 3: Retrieve Most Relevant DIs
                    Access connected DIs from the graph
                    Select full documents or mind map summaries
                Stage 4: Assemble Context
                    Compile retrieved information for answer generation
                        consists of
                            retrieved DIs
                            information contained in relevent DI Nodes which were visited
                                would include
                                    information about
                                        Dr William Brown
                                        Good Health Hospital
                    Adjust detail level based on query complexity
                Stage 5: Use Assembled Context to Answer Question
                    Compile retrieved information for answer generation
                        consists of
                            retrieved DIs
                            information contained in relevent DI Nodes which were visited
                                would include
                                    information about
                                        Dr William Brown
                                        Good Health Hospital
                    Adjust detail level based on query complexity
            Additional Considerations
                Handling Ambiguity
                    Uses STE(1) to disambiguate terms
                    May prompt for user clarification if ambiguity remains
                Query Expansion
                    Finds related terms to improve search results
                    E.g., "Communicable Disease" retrieved instead of "Infectious Disease"
                Scalability & Performance
                    Priority ranking for most relevant nodes
                    Graph pruning to optimize storage
