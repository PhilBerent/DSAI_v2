                              <strong>Centralized Project-Wide Context</strong><br>Each project 
                              has a dedicated, persistent context store that 
                              automatically applies to all conversations within 
                              that project. This means any information you upload 
                              or share in one chat is seamlessly accessible in 
                              every other chat under the same project.

                                When you upload a file to the project, the system 
                                instantly parses and indexes it.

                                map—are stored in a project-wide database. The 
                                assistant can query these files at will, pulling 
                                only relevant excerpts into context as needed.

                                The project’s memory transcends individual chat 
                                sessions. If you close a conversation, come back 
                                days later, and open a fresh chat within the same 
                                project, the assistant still retains all 
                                previously uploaded data.

                                Every document, note, or snippet gets 
                                automatically tagged by topic, date, and relevant 
                                keywords.

                                When you ask a question, the assistant performs a 
                                behind-the-scenes “context search,” retrieving 
                                only the relevant pieces from the project’s store. 
                                This ensures you never run into token limits just 
                                by uploading many files.

                                progress updates, or strategic next steps—spanning 
                                any timeline you specify (e.g., “last week’s

                            study something about all aspects

        Overview
            Basic Idea
                Idea Statement
                        Create a project oriented AI app which can store a large library of information many times greater than the LLM context window and load relavant parts of data into context so that these can be taken into account in answering questions
                Problem/Solution Statement
                        Problem
                            LLM context limited (ChatGPT4 approximately 75 pages)
                            projects may involve considerable amounts of data
                                documents
                                    can be large size because
                                        many documents
                                        long documents
                                    e.g.
                                        reference materials
                                        project presentations and output
                                        correspondance
                                        Zoom/Google Meet transcripts
                                        spreadsheets
                                        activity journals and to do lists
                                LLM conversations concerning project
                                    long conversartions
                                    many conversations
                                work of many collaborators
                                    written material
                                    code
                                    LLM conversations
                                    etc
                            data relavent to project grows over time
                            This means it is not possible for LLM to be aware of all relavent details of project in answering question
                        solution
                            create indexed and tagged "library" of data
                                important documents and data uploaded at initiation of project
                                call this the "DataStore"
                            Master Content Directory
                                list of items in DataStore
                                    each item
                                        tagged by subject/person/date etc
                            Datastore
                                added to

                                            some elements

            MindMap Usage
                General
                        mind mapping a vital part of use
                        mind maps have branches and sub branches for each subject
                when element added
                        always mind map notes created

                    Use of Mind Maps
                            What they are
                                text based tree structures where
                                    Primary Node
                                        The central "Primary Node" represents the main subject or topic of the map.
                                    Branches and Nodes
                                        Nodes (subtopics) branch out from the Primary Node, each representing a specific aspect or subcategory of the main subject.
                                        Each branch can have multiple levels of child nodes, adding further detail.
                                        A node's parent node determines its context, and its child nodes expand on its details.
                                    Node Levels
                                        The level of a node is determined by how many parent nodes it has.
                                        For example:
                                            A node directly connected to the Primary Node is a Level 1 node.
                                            A node with three parent nodes is a Level 4 node.
                                    Expansion
                                        Additional branches and levels are added as needed to capture all relevant details about the topic being explored.

                                Mind maps are simply text based tree structures
                                Mind Maps therefore stored as text files where
                                    the level of each node is given by the number of preceding tabs
